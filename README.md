# Welcome to our ML Project 

This project is being developed by **Leandro PUNZANO** and **Fatima EL KHALFI**, students at **Intitut Mines-Telecom Atlantique**, in the context of the _Algorithmes et Apprentissage Authomatique_ course, tutored by professor Bilal SAID.

The purpose of the project is to gain knowledge and develop our competences in Machine Learning techniques. We're using the [Adult Income Dataset](datasets/adult.data) to perform a classification task - predict wether an US citizen earns more or less than 50K USD per year.
